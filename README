This is a simple server that accesses tweets on http://localhost/stream/search_term_here

It requires the following:
express
ntwitter
socket.io

TODO:
Seperate client code into a template in a seperate file
Add ability to limit number of tweets shown on page
Use twitter search API to create initial seed tweets (also can choose number of seeds, maybe 5?)
